## AI-Assisted Installation (Easiest!)

Let an AI assistant install Secret Santa for you! Works with:

---

## Self-Host Guide

Host Secret Santa on your own computer or server. Perfect for keeping your family's data private!

### What You'll Need

- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Docker Desktop (free) - [Install Guide](#step-1-install-docker)
- A Gmail account (for email notifications)
- About 10 minutes

---

### Step 1: Install Docker

Docker runs the app in a container, so you don't need to install anything else.

| Operating System | Download Link                                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Windows**      | [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) |
| **Mac**          | [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)         |
| **Linux**        | [Docker Engine for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)                     |

After installing:

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Wait for it to start (you'll see "Docker Desktop is running" in the system tray/menu bar)

---

### Step 2: Download Secret Santa

**Option A: Using Git (if you have it installed)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/secret-santa.git
cd secret-santa
```

**Option B: Download ZIP**

1. Click the green "Code" button at the top of this page
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP to a folder (e.g., `C:\secret-santa` or `~/secret-santa`)
4. Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder

---

### Step 3: Set Up Email (Optional but Recommended)

Email notifications let participants know when matches are assigned and when wishlists are updated. The app works without email, but participants won't receive notifications.

#### How to Create a Gmail App Password

> **Why an App Password?** Google requires special passwords for apps to keep your account secure. This is a one-time setup.

1. **Go to your Google Account Security page**
   - Open: https://myaccount.google.com/security

2. **Enable 2-Step Verification** (if not already enabled)
   - Under "How you sign in to Google", click **2-Step Verification**
   - Follow the prompts to enable it

3. **Create an App Password**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - You may need to sign in again
   - Under "Select app", choose **Mail**
   - Under "Select device", choose **Other (Custom name)**
   - Type: `Secret Santa`
   - Click **Generate**

4. **Copy the password**
   - You'll see a 16-character password like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - Copy this password (you can remove the spaces)

5. **Save it in your config file** (next step)

---

### Step 4: Configure Your Settings

1. **Copy the example config file:**

   **Mac/Linux:**

   ```bash
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   ```

   **Windows (Command Prompt):**

   ```cmd
   copy server\.env.example server\.env
   ```

2. **Edit the config file** (`server/.env`):

   Open in any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, VS Code, etc.) and update these values:

   ```env
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3001
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3001

   # Your Gmail credentials (from Step 3)
   EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop
   ```

   > **Note:** Remove any spaces from the App Password

---

### Step 5: Start the App

Run this single command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait about 30 seconds for everything to start, then open your browser to:

**http://localhost:3001**

> **Tip:** To check if it's running: `docker-compose logs -f`
> Press `Ctrl+C` to stop viewing logs (the app keeps running)

---

### Step 6: Create Your Admin Account

The first user needs to be created via command line:

```bash
docker exec -it secret-santa bun scripts/create-admin.ts
```

You'll be prompted to enter:

- Email address
- Display name
- Password

This account can manage users and generate Secret Santa matches!

---

### Step 7: Add Family Members

1. Log in with your admin account
2. Go to the **Admin** tab
3. Click **Add User** for each family member
4. Share their login credentials (they'll receive a welcome email if you set up email)

---

### Step 8: Generate Matches

When everyone is added:

1. Go to the **Admin** tab
2. Click **Generate Matches**
3. Everyone gets assigned a random Secret Santa!

---

## Share With Family (Remote Access)

Want family members to access the app from their own homes? Here are three options:

### Option A: Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)

Free, secure, and doesn't expose your home IP address.

1. **Create a Cloudflare account** at https://cloudflare.com

2. **Install cloudflared:**
   - **Mac:** `brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared`
   - **Windows:** [Download installer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/)
   - **Linux:** `curl -L https://pkg.cloudflare.com/cloudflared-stable-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb && sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb`

3. **Login to Cloudflare:**

   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel login
   ```

4. **Create a tunnel:**

   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel create secret-santa
   ```

5. **Run the tunnel:**

   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3001
   ```

   You'll get a URL like `https://random-words.trycloudflare.com` - share this with family!

> **Tip:** For a permanent custom domain, follow [Cloudflare's full tunnel guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/).

---

### Option B: Tailscale (Easiest for Tech-Savvy Families)

Every family member installs Tailscale, creating a private network.

1. **Install Tailscale** on your computer: https://tailscale.com/download
2. **Create an account** and connect your device
3. **Note your Tailscale IP** (looks like `100.x.x.x`)
4. **Have family install Tailscale** on their devices
5. **Share the URL:** `http://100.x.x.x:3001`

> Everyone needs Tailscale installed, but it's very secure and easy.

---

### Option C: Port Forwarding (Advanced)

Opens a port on your router. Less secure, but works without extra software.

1. **Find your local IP:**
   - **Mac/Linux:** `ifconfig | grep "inet "`
   - **Windows:** `ipconfig`
   - Look for something like `192.168.1.x`

2. **Log into your router** (usually http://192.168.1.1)

3. **Set up port forwarding:**
   - External port: `3001`
   - Internal IP: Your computer's IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
   - Internal port: `3001`

4. **Find your public IP:** https://whatismyip.com

5. **Update your config** (`server/.env`):

   ```env
   CLIENT_URL=http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:3001
   ```

6. **Share the URL:** `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:3001`

> **Warning:** Your public IP may change. Consider using a dynamic DNS service like [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) or [No-IP](https://www.noip.com/).

## Managing Your App

### View Logs

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Stop the App

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Restart the App

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Update to Latest Version

```bash
git pull
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Docker is not running"

Make sure Docker Desktop is open and shows "Docker Desktop is running" in the system tray.

### "Cannot connect to localhost:3001"

1. Check if the container is running: `docker ps`
2. Check the logs for errors: `docker-compose logs`
3. Make sure port 3001 isn't used by another app

### "Emails aren't sending"

1. Double-check your Gmail App Password (no spaces)
2. Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google account
3. Check the logs: `docker-compose logs | grep -i email`

### "Cannot create admin user"

Make sure the container is running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it secret-santa bun scripts/create-admin.ts
```

### "Permission denied" errors on Linux

Run Docker commands with `sudo`, or add your user to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Then log out and back in.
